            Despite coming up in Australia, indie rock band, Last Dinosaurs would say they're an international enterprise – and they’ve got a track record to prove it.

            “Australians have a natural urge to explore,” remarks Lachlan Caskey, which might be why their energetic sound has resonated with fans all around the world. Together with his brother Sean Caskey and Michael Sloane, Last Dinosaurs make up the quintessential touring band, having played sold out headlining shows and festivals across UK, Europe, Southeast Asia, South Africa, and the Americas. The success of studio albums, Million Years, Wellness, and most recently, Yumeno Garden, have truly taken them around the world and back.
            
            In addition to headlining tours, the band has opened for international acts such as Foals, Matt & Kim, Los Valentinos and Foster the People, playing festivals including Splendour In the Grass, Laneway, Falls Festival, and Field Day to name a few.
            
            Despite coming so far already, Last Dinosaurs is only just getting started.</p>
